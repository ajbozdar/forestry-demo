I just added bootstrap to this site, and it got trapped into usual design issues immediately. Website menu is gone up down in Chrome browser. It works fine in Firefox.

I am constantly testing various design and deployment features here. I expect SiteLeaf powers are still there to explore.

I'll get back soon.
